# Stylesheets

All styling must be written in Sass, which will compile into `public/main.css`. For the sake of scalability, stylesheets will be organized using the [ITCSS Method](https://speakerdeck.com/dafed/managing-css-projects-with-itcsshttps://speakerdeck.com/dafed/managing-css-projects-with-itcss) created by [Harry Roberts](https://github.com/csswizardry).

## Adding a new Sass file

## TO DO
- [ ] Add Sass loader to Webpack
- [ ] Add PostCSS processing
- [ ] Have Webpack autodetect new files
- [ ] Incorporate Critical CSS output for performance
- [ ] Create a font-family mixin that outputs serif by default until body class `.fonts-loaded` is fired.
